# getdatetime
A simple HTML Code that gets your current time in Month/Day/Year - H:MM:SS format.
<br>
<br>
How it works?
<br>
1.) It gets your current date and time via JavaScript.
<br>
2.) It syncs the current date and time via JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: It does not depend on a time server, the time and date of your current device is the one being used. So, it is possible to use it offline.
